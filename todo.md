- Prevent tooltip body opacity from being 1 until left and top are calculated.
- Add placement logic to help the tooltip stay in the viewport, with last resort being bottom with scroll.
- Add option for preferred side, which will try the preferred side first
- Add option to ignore viewport limitations, allowing the preferred side to persist even offscreen
- Add ability to mouse onto the tooltip itself
  - Use timeouts and careful placement of the tooltip's invisible overlay to prevent dismissal
- Add showDelay option
- Add hideDelay option
- Add aria-describedby to original element when the tooltip is visible
  - Figure out how to make a unique id, preferably without having to pull in a library
